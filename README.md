# liri-node-app

Very much like Siri or Alexa, Liri is a comand line application that takes a comand/input from the user, and executes it printing the results diretly on the terminal.  The four comands that are currently supported are:

*'my-tweets'\n
*'spotify-this-song'\n
*'my-movie'\n
*'do-what-it-says'\n

More commands will be added in the future.
