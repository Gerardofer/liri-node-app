# liri-node-app

Very much like Siri or Alexa, Liri is a comand line application that takes a comand/input from the user, and executes it printing the results diretly on the terminal.  The four comands that are currently supported are:

'my-tweets'

'spotify-this-song'

'my-movie'

'do-what-it-says'

More commands will be added in the future.
